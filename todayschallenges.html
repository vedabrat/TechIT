The sweaty bus ride

There is a tube strike today so instead of getting the London Underground home you have decided to take the bus. It's a hot day and you have been sitting on the bus for over an hour, but the bus is hardly moving. Your arm is sticking to the window and sweat drips off your nose as you try to read your neighbour's book when you say to yourself, "This is ridiculous. I could have walked faster than this!" Suddenly you have an idea for an app that helps people decide whether to walk or take the bus home when the London Underground is on strike.
You rush home (relatively speaking) and begin to define the function that will underpin your app.

Function specification

You must create a function which takes three parameters; walking distance home, distance the bus must travel, and the combined distance of walking from the office to the bus stop and from the bus stop to your house. All distances are in kilometres.
So for example, if your home is 5km away by foot, and the bus that takes you home travels 6km, but you have to walk 500 metres to the bus stop to catch it and 500 metres to your house once the bus arrives (i.e. 1km in total), which is faster, walking or taking the bus?

Example - Which of these is faster?:

Start---Walk 5km--->End
Start---Walk 500m---Bus 6km---Walk 500m--->End
Walking speed and bus driving speed have been given to you as two pre-loaded variables ($global_variables in Ruby).

walk = 5 (km/hr) bus = 8 (km/hr)

The function must return the fastest option, either "Walk" or "Bus". If the walk is going to be over 2 hours, the function should recommend that you take the bus. If the walk is going to be under 10 minutes, the function should recommend that you walk. If both options are going to take the same amount of time, the function should recommend that you walk<span style="text-decoration: none">:</span></p>

      Write a program to find count of the most frequent item of an array.

Assume that input is array of integers.

Ex.:

input array: [3, -1, -1, -1, 2, 3, -1, 3, -1, 2, 4, 9, 3]
ouptut: 5
Most frequent number in example array is -1. It occurs 5 times in input array.
def most_frequent_item_count(collection)
  # Do your magic. :)

			<span style="text-decoration: none">You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#Examples:

Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"

Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"
#Input

A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an error in the test cases). You do not need to test for this. This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.

#Output

The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.
